Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objects program draws a square, a rectangle, and a circle on a 640 x 480
plane. First I create a cv::Mat object that is one channel with 8 bits to 
represent a gray scale image. Then I proceed to call cvRectangle with a
randomly generated point. Another point is made from the random point to they
are fed into the cvRectangle function to draw the rectange. Then the pixels
are processed one at a time and their intensity is set by using: OXFF - 'd' 
where 'd' is the euclidian distance produced by:
d = sqrt(((x1+x2)^2) - ((y1+y2)^2))

This produces a gradient shading effect on the objects where the middle point
is white and as the distance grows, the pixels become darker, or lose
intensity. Both square objects are produced in the same fashion where two
points are calculated then the center is calculated for the intensity 
calculations. However, I had to switch the method of drawing the circle. 

I had to use the cvRectangle method to draw the circle and fill in the pixels
with a constant intensity of 255. I consider a rectangle around the circle a
region of interest (ROI) and give any pixel of intensity 255 a newly calculated
intensity of OXFF - distance from center. After this the image is displayed
for the user.

Questions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)A CCD camera chip of dimensions 7 x 7 mm,and having 1024 x 1024 elements,
 is focused on a square, flat area, located 0.5m away. How many line pairs 
per mm will this camera be able to resolve? The camera is equipped with a 
35mm lens.(Hint: Model the imaging process as in Fig. 2.3, with the focal 
length of the camera lens substituting for the focal length of the eye.)

1 Answer) With this question being so closely related to the figure 2.3 there
is relatively little work to do. Let 'h' denote our unknown height of the square
we are trying to capture. Then we get (7mm/35mm) = (h/500mm) where 7mm is the height
of our chip and 35mm being the distance from lens to chip and 500mm coming 
from our converted 0.5m distance to the square. Solved this gives us h = 100mm.
Since we have 1024 elements in that 100mm we do (1024/100) = 10 elements/mm. Since we
want line pairs we divide by 2 to give us 5 linepairs/mm.

2a)How many minutes would it take to transmit a 1024 x 1024 image with 256 
intensity levels using a 56K baud modem?

2a Answer) Total bits = Image Height * Image Width * bits for intensity
	   lg(256) = 8 bit representation for intensity levels
	   Total bits = 1024 * 1024 * 8 = 8,388,608bits
	   At a rate of 56000bits/second, it would take (8,388,608bits/56000)bits/second
	   which come to 149.79657seconds. If we divide by 60 for minutes, we 
	   get 2.4966 minutes. Rounding for significance we get 2.50 minutes.

2b)What would the time be at 3000K baud, a representative medium speed of a
phone DSL connection?

2b Answer) Total bits = Image Height * Image Width * bits for intensity
           lg(256) = 8 bit representation for intensity levels
           Total bits = 1024 * 1024 * 8 = 8,388,608bits
	   At a rate of 3,000K baud or 3,000,000 bits/sec it would take
 	   (8,388,608(bits)/3,000,000(bits/sec)) = 2.7962 seconds
	   If we round, it would be approximately 2.8 seconds to transfer
	   the image.
